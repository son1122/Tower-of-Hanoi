<h3>2. make a List of technical difficulties and study all of them</h3>
    
    2.1 How to make Drag and Drop
    
    2.2 How Local Storage Work
    
    2.3 How Tower of Hanoi Algorithm work
    
<h3>3. make a simple step plan</h3>

    3.1 initial project with HTML5 Boiler Plate
    
    3.2 Make a Poll and try drag and drop function
    
    3.3 Make a better UI
    
    3.4 Make it responsive 
    
    3.5 make Time base scoring
    
    3.6 make local storage to keep score and player name
    
    3.7 make game response
    
    3.8 add solve function
    
    3.9 try to make solve animation
    
    3.10 finish and clean it up

What would you do differently?


    I have no idea how to make this in different way
  
  
What are you most proud of?


    study and try to make it work
  
  
What would you do next?


    if possible try to fix bug when press solve button and prepend() can not delay
